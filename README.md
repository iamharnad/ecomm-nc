# Mike E-Commerce

Mike is a family-owned company, founded in 2022, and inspired by the belief that the best sports products should be accessible to everyone.

Ever-evolving and high performance design, the best quality at the lowest possible price, and expert advice that customers of all ages, backgrounds and skill levels can access in-store or online, from anywhere, at any time, is what makes us who we are. And weâ€™re pretty proud of that.
